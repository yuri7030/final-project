## Overview

Welcome to the Google Form Clone project! This project aims to clone some of the essential features of Google Forms, allowing users to create, manage, and respond to surveys. Below, you will find a detailed introduction to each feature that has been implemented in this project.

## Features

### 1. Get List of Surveys

As a user with permission to access, you can retrieve a list of surveys. The list is paginated, enabling you to view surveys in chunks. Moreover, you can apply filters to search for surveys based on the survey title text, making it easier to find specific surveys among many.

### 2. Add a New Survey

You have the ability to create and add a new survey. This feature allows you to customize the survey with various question types, set permissions, and define survey settings.

### 3. Update a Specific Survey

Once a survey is created, you can update its details as needed. This includes modifying the survey questions, permissions, and other settings to ensure it stays up-to-date and relevant.

### 4. Delete a Specific Survey

If you no longer need a survey, you can easily delete it. Be cautious, as this action is irreversible and will permanently remove the survey and all related data.

### 5. Get List of Questionnaires

For a specific survey, you can fetch a list of questionnaires. The list is paginated, allowing you to navigate through questionnaires efficiently. Additionally, you can search for questionnaires based on their text content.

### 6. Answer a Specific Survey

As a respondent, you can answer a specific survey by providing answers to the questions. This feature ensures that users can participate in surveys smoothly.

### 7. Aggregate Answers into Percentages

After respondents have answered questionnaires, the system aggregates their answers and calculates percentages for each option. This gives survey creators a clear overview of the responses.

### 8. Aggregate Total Number of Users Who Answered a Specific Survey

Knowing the total number of users who have answered a particular survey is crucial for evaluating its success and reach. This feature allows survey creators to gather valuable insights.

### 9. Unit Tests Coverage

Throughout the development process, unit tests have been meticulously written to cover all functionalities. Unit tests ensure that the code is robust, reliable, and free from errors.
