If you've ever used Google Forms to create surveys or questionnaires, you'll find this project both exciting and instructive. Below, we'll introduce each feature that has been implemented, and we're proud to announce that every feature is thoroughly covered by unit tests.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Get List of Surveys

This feature allows users with the appropriate permissions to access a list of surveys. The list supports pagination, enabling users to view a manageable number of surveys at a time. Additionally, users can apply filters based on various conditions, such as searching for survey titles that match specific text.

### 2. Add a New Survey

Creating surveys is a fundamental feature, and in this project, you can add new surveys with ease. The interface provides a user-friendly way to define survey questions and settings.

### 3. Update a Specific Survey

Once a survey is created, it's essential to be able to update its content and settings. This feature enables users to modify specific surveys without hassle.

### 4. Delete a Specific Survey

Unwanted surveys can be removed using this feature. When a survey is no longer needed, it can be deleted to keep the survey list clean and organized.

### 5. Get List of Questionnaires

Within each survey, there are questionnaires that need to be managed. This feature allows users to retrieve a list of questionnaires, which is paginated for easier viewing. Users can also apply filters to search for specific questionnaire text.

### 6. Answer a Specific Survey

Survey data wouldn't be complete without answers from respondents. With this feature, users can submit their answers to a specific survey effortlessly.

### 7. Aggregate Answers into Percentages

Data analysis is a vital aspect of surveys. This feature aggregates all answers of every questionnaire in a specific survey and presents the results as percentages.
